If the cantiga was of good or excellent [cantiga_quality|E], you'll get a somewhat randomized [character_modifier|E] whose effects are based on the topic. Cantigas of excellent [cantiga_quality|E] can also be turned into [artifacts|E] via the [decision|E] to $RICE_galicia_promote_cantiga$."

 game_concept_cantiga_quality_desc:0 "Each [cantiga|E] you create (via the [decision|E] to $RICE_galicia_cantiga_decision$) is considered to have a certain level of quality. There are three levels of quality: #Y acceptable#!, #G good#!, and #D excellent#!.\n\nThe higher the quality of the [cantiga|E], the more rewards you'll receive after composing it. At a good or excellent level, for example, you'll gain a [character_modifier|E] with randomized effects. At an excellent level, you'll gain access to another [decision|E], $RICE_galicia_promote_cantiga$, to make a book [artifact|E] out of the [cantiga|E].\n\nQuality is determined by several factors, including: your [skills|E]; your [traits|E]; whether you've composed cantigas before; and if your [culture|E] has the $tradition_RICE_galician_portuguese_poetry_name$ [tradition|E]."

 game_concept_santiago_modifiers_desc:0 "Positive [character_modifiers|E] are related to Saint James (or Santiago) and give various military and personal bonuses that can be gained via a [decision|E] to $RICE_galicia_pray_to_santiago$, which costs [piety|E]. The [decision|E] is available to all Christian [rulers|E] with a [realm_capital|E] in [GetGeographicalRegion('world_europe_west_iberia').GetName] who meet a minimum [piety_level|E] requirement, once a Christian [ruler|E] of Santiago (in northeast [GetGeographicalRegion('world_europe_west_iberia').GetName]) takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_galicia_alter_saint_james_tomb$.\n\nWhen you take this [decision|E] is that there is a chance you will gain a beneficial [character_modifier|E] representing different aspects of Saint James. The effects of these $game_concept_santiago_modifiers$ depends on the current [struggle_phase|E] of the [iberian_struggle|E] or which [decision|E] was taken to end it.\n\nIf you are of a [culture|E] of $heritage_iberian_name$ [heritage|E], or one which is [struggle_involved|E] in the [iberian_struggle|E], this [decision|E] will be cheaper and there is a higher chance of getting a good result. [virtues|E] and the [GetTrait('zealous').GetName( GetPlayer )] [trait|E], as well as [sins|E] and the [GetTrait('cynical').GetName( GetPlayer )] [trait|E] also have a slight positive or negative impact on your chances of getting a better [modifier|E] or any at all. [piety_level|E] can also help with cost and chances of getting a good result.\n\nIf you no longer qualify for these [character_modifiers|E] by converting to another [faith|E], you will lose the modifiers immediately."

For instance, he enforced stricter rules on local clergy, and curtailed many locals’ rights (in their view, at least) in favor of the pilgrims. In particular, his renovation of Saint James’ tomb was seen as desecration to many locals, given it was supposedly built by the apostle’s disciples. Ultimately, locals felt like the city was no longer their home, and that it was now dominated by throngs of foreign pilgrims and the tyrannical, unworthy Gelmírez.\n\nIn 1116, the city’s patricians and local clergy formed a secret brotherhood against Gelmírez. During their subsequent uprising, many locals supported them in reclaiming local spaces “lost” to pilgrims.\n\nGelmírez himself was chased by a mob into the Cathedral’s bell tower, which they set on fire. He managed to escape, and after the rebellion’s failure, he remained in power in Santiago. He would continue his programme of expanding the Cathedral and encouraging further pilgrimage, but ultimately did not resolve the root issue of tensions with the locals. A more short-lived, second rebellion happened in 1136; it, too, resulted in no lasting changes."
