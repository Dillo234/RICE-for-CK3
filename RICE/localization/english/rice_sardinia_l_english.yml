Our first records of Palios date back to the medieval period, though they may have had Roman-era antecedents. During Medieval and Renaissance eras, they were important religious and civic occasions, often associated with Saints' feast days. Most modern palios and equivalent horse races are recent inventions, or reinventions of older traditions. The oldest extant Palio, and the most famous one, is Siena's, whose modern form dates back to the 1633 CE. However, it is attested in a document as early as the 1239, where the palio's rules are discussed in some detail, suggesting it had already been run for years before that."

In modern times, the oldest surviving Palio, the #italic Palio di Siena#! in Siena, is typically held in a circuit around the #italic Piazza del Campo#!, the main town square in the city. However, before the 17th century, Siena's palios would not be run circuitously; instead, they started at or outside the city gate and passed through the city, before ending at the town square."

 sardinia.0028.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The winning jockeys of medieval and Renaissance palios were often paid for the services. Some were women or even children, the latter due to their small size. For instance, a palio in Siena held on August 15, 1581, was won by a 12 year old shepherdess, Virginia Tacci. She was not only immortalized by poets as a female warrior of sorts, but, becuase Siena was ruled by Florence at the time, she became a symbol of local pride and resistance to Florentine domination."

As palios were often held on religious feast days, they were also an opportunity for the city and whoever organized the palio races to perform charitable acts.
