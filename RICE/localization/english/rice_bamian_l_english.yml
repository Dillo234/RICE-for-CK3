Even after Afghanistan was Islamicized, Muslim attitudes towards the Bamiyan Buddha Statues have varied over time and place, in contrast to the Taliban government's destruction of the statues in 2001. For instance, local folklore believed the two statues to be star-crossed lovers who were turned into stone; these stories were influential among the Hazara people who lived in Bamiyan for centuries, to the point some scholars theorized the Taliban destroyed the statues as part of their ongoing oppression of the Hazaras. Medieval Islamic scholars and poets categorized and even praised the statues and their beauty as #italic 'aja'ib#!, or wonders to be marveled. For instance, Jahangir Mirza, the brother of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, took a detour while on a military expedition to sightsee in Bamian in 1506 CE."

The #italic Kitāb al-Fihrist#!, a 10th century compendium of knowledge by Islamic Persian scholar Ibn al-Nadim, makes note of some of the customs surrounding the Buddha statues of Bamian. Supposedly, if pilgrims were negligent in performing the necessary religious rituals on the way to the statues, they would have to go back to where they first saw the statues and re-do everything again. Ibn al-Nadaim may have been privy to this information because Bamian and some of its royal family likely still remained Buddhist into the 10th century."

My mind was too distracted as I made my way to the Buddha statues – perhaps I was too entranced by the beauty of [GetTitleByKey('c_bamian').GetNameNoTier], or maybe I was worrying about important business back at home, or it might have happened that I was thinking about worldly matters.\n\nEither way, I botched some of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] rituals I was doing on the way to the statues. Normally, this means I have to go all the way back to the original location where I first saw the Buddha statues appear on the horizon, and do this all over again…."

 bamian.0033.desc:0 "Finally, I have arrived at the magnificent Buddha statues of [GetTitleByKey('c_bamian').GetNameNoTier]! The two statues tower over myself and everyone present.\n\nThe larger statue represents Vairocana, the primordial Buddha who symbolizes ultimate wisdom and enlightenment, and from whom all other Buddhas emanate. The smaller statue is of Siddhartha, the historical Buddha.\n\nWhile I performed many rituals on the way to these statues, there are still more to do, such as offerings of incense, making spiritual vows and aspirations, and providing offerings to the statues. Perhaps I could make even more offerings to show that I am a devoted [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName]."

 bamian.0034.desc:0 "After I finished performing all the necessary religious rituals I had to do as part of my pilgrimage to the Buddha statues of [GetTitleByKey('c_bamian').GetNameNoTier], I took time to explore and better appreciate the site where these statues are located.\n\nThere are many caves and surfaces surrounding the two statues, which are painted with murals depicting a wide range of subjects, from mighty kings to solar deities. Though the paint is faded and not of the same vibrant quality when this place was first created by devout followers of [buddhist.GetName], it is still a breathtaking sight.\n\nAlas, though one could easily spend days examining each and every cave, I only have so much time here. With my spiritual experience concluded, it is now time to go home."
