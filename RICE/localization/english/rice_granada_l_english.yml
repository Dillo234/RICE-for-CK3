 granada.0013.desc:0 "[granada.GetNameNoTier] is currently home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Iberia. Legend even has it that the city was founded by Jews centuries ago.\n\nFor years, Granada’s leadership has relied heavily on the Jews in the local administration. Due to their minority status, they are generally more trustworthy than non-Jewish locals who may harbor dreams of sedition or compete with each other for power and influence. However, this has bred envy, discontent, and resentment from many of the region’s non-Jewish population who eye my Jewish officials with suspicion.\n\nRecently, a local [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] poet and scholar has written a malicious poem denigrating Granada's Jews, claiming they are vile, immoral people who control the state, and that I must rid my administration of them. Of course, such an unhinged poem made little impression on me, but I've heard it has caused quite a stir among the city’s non-Jewish inhabitants...."

 granada.0014.t:0 "The Mob"
 granada.0014.desc:0 "I was sleeping at my manor in [granada.GetNameNoTier] when my guards woke me late at night - chaos has erupted in the city's streets!\n\nApparently, a false rumor had spread earlier today that [yusuf.GetFullName] and others Jews had defected to an enemy ruler, opened the city gates, and killed me. Thanks to rising recent anti-Jewish sentiment, a mob quickly formed to "protect" the city. Obviously, I’m alive and no enemy army is in sight.\n\nBefore I know it, [yusuf.GetFirstName] arrives in a panic, begging for help. Moments later, the mob storms my palace, screaming how they will kill the "traitor" [yusuf.GetFirstName] before going for his fellow Jews next. I rush to the meet mob to reassure them that I am fine and demand they stand down, but they pay no heed.\n\nThe mob is now moving fast towards [yusuf.GetFirstName], and I and my guards have little time to react."

 granada.0015.desc:0 "I rub my forehead as I hear more reports coming in from the Jewish quarters. They are very grim.\n\nLast night, I was powerless in the face of such a large mob. They descended upon [yusuf.GetFirstName] and killed him before I could do anything. Then, just as I was trying to gather my soldiers in an attempt to restore order, the mob descended upon the city’s Jewish quarters, murdering any Jew they could find. Such was their rage that even a number of non-Jews who were currently there at the time were killed.\n\nBy the time my soldiers could restore order, hundreds if not thousands of innocents must have died, while Jews who survived are fleeing elsewhere. Parts of the city has been destroyed, and much of my administration is in tatters due to the sudden loss of many skilled Jewish officials."
 granada.0015.a:0 "This is a dark day for [granada.GetNameNoTier]."
 granada.0016.t:0 "Order Restored"
 granada.0016.desc.peaceful:0 "The next hour or two is extremely tense. While my guards quietly move [yusuf.GetFirstName] to a safe location, I do my best to calmly, loudly, and firmly explain to the mob that nothing is going on. The rumor that [yusuf.GetFirstName] betraying the city to our enemies is just that - a rumor.\n\nTo my relief, my words seem to work. The screams and shouts for violence die down, and the mob begins to dissipate.\n\nLater that day, I check on [yusuf.GetFirstName] to make sure [yusuf.GetSheHe] is alright. [yusuf.GetSheHe|U] is shaken, but will survive. I then go to the Jewish quarters to reassure the city’s Jews that nothing will happen to them. Meanwhile, I and my officials will continue monitoring the situation to ensure this doesn’t happen again.\n\nAll in all, thank [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] nothing happened…. I was worried for a moment that something horrible would happen."
 granada.0016.desc.force:0 "My soldiers thankfully responded to my commands quickly despite the chaotic situation. Though outnumbered, they moved in swiftly to escort [yusuf.GetFirstName] away, and called in reinforcements stationed elsewhere in the city.\n\nUnfortunately, the mob was in too much of a frenzied state, and these daring fools tried to overpower my troops in their attempt to find and attack [yusuf.GetFirstName]. Of course, they were no match for my soldiers, and some of the mob died in the ensuing clash.\n\nThat morning, I was glad to hear that [yusuf.GetFirstName] was safe and sound. There was some violence against other Jews in the city, but my soldiers managed to put a stop to that.\n\nAll in all, it could have been a lot worse. However, even as I visit the Jewish quarters today to reassure the city’s Jews that nothing will happen to them, I know the situation is very precarious. My officials and I will continue monitoring the situation to ensure this doesn’t happen again, but my actions might not be seen in a positive light by some inhabitants of [granada.GetNameNoTier]."

 granada.0017.desc:0 "Silk is a profitable trade, and in the old days, [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] used to be the center of that trade in Iberia. However, with more recent changes in Iberia’s geopolitical situation and global trade routes, [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] is no longer able to produce the vast amounts of silk it once did.\n\nWhile other rulers on the peninsula scramble to finance the growth of silk workshops elsewhere, I am blessed to rule [almeria.GetNameNoTier]. Many merchants I am acquainted with have told me that it is the perfect settlement to take over the role [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] had as the center of Iberia’s silk industry - some even say that it may surpass [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] one day, but I am not sure whether I’ll see that in my lifetime.\n\nEither way, [almeria.GetNameNoTier] is one of the most important ports in the Western Mediterranean, and so, it can export large amounts of silks to other lands. This, no doubt, will ensure the city's future prosperity."
 granada.0017.a:0 "We'll profit greatly from all this silk!"
 granada.0018.t:0 "Almerian Silk"
 granada.0018.desc:0 "When the Arabs and Berbers first came to the Iberian peninsula, they brought not only Islam with them, but also other ideas and customs, like the methods to produce fine silks. [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] soon became a major hub of silk production, due to royal patronage by the Umayyads.\n\nNow, however, due to years of conflict in Iberia, and changes in global trade, [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] has declined as a leading producer of silk. Silk workshops have sprung up in many Iberian cities, but [almeria.GetNameNoTier] stands above them all, as it has clearly inherited the mantle of Iberia’s center of silk production from [cordoba.GetNameNoTier].\n\nThe elites in [almeria.GetNameNoTier], particularly [silk_investor.GetTitledFirstName], have realized the potential profit of the silk trade, and have begun to heavily invest in the city’s silk industry. As one of the largest seaports in the Western Mediterranean, the city is well-suited to export so-called Almerian Silk, which is starting to gain renown throughout Europe and the Middle East for its quality."

Some focus on delighting visitors with views of beautiful gardens, lovely architecture, or awe-inspiring countryside vistas. Others cultivate an air of sophistication by inviting skilled poets to come engage in intellectual and literary pursuits. Yet others prefer to entice learned scholars to stick around to perform botanical or agronomic experiments.\n\nAnyways, once the other guests arrive, who knows what amusements we’ll enjoy in the coming days?"
