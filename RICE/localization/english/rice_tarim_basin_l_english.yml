Long ago, the city was founded by a certain Kustana, son of Ashoka, the great Buddhist Emperor in India. When a prophecy said the boy would become king during his father's lifetime, Ashoka, fearing his son as a threat, abandoned him in the Tarim Basin. The young child was suckled by an earth-breast, and later adopted by a Chinese king who had prayed to the deity Vaisravana, protector of the Buddhist teachings, for a son. After a series of events, Khotan was settled by Indians and Chinese led by Kustana.\n\nAnyways, this is but one version of the legend about Khotan's founding that I've heard."

The quote above is taken directly from his book’s introduction.\n\nIn his work, Kashgari provides more than just linguistic information - he also discusses history, geography, religion, and his strong opinions. For example, he was proud of his Turkic heritage, and cautioned his fellow Turks against adopting a sedentary lifestyle, as he believed their old, nomadic ways were superior. He also expressed hostility towards Buddhist and pagan beliefs.\n\nAt any rate, Kashgari was supposedly related to the rulers of the Karakhanid dynasty; such a connection is not entirely proven, but it is plausible. If he was of Karakhanid descent, his ancestor might have been one Hussayn or Hasan, who conquered the Samanid capital Bukhara in 992 CE. Kashgari died in the late 11th century or early 12th century, having made his mark as an important figure in Turkic cultural and literary history."

Such a lofty goal may not be accomplished with just one book like this, but it is an important step nonetheless.
