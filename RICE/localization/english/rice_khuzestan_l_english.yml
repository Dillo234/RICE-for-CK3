There are several cities that claim to have the tomb of the Biblical figure Daniel, but Šuš (ancient Susa) is the most well-known and is a local site of pilgrimage for Jews and Muslims. According to legend, after people on both sides of the river flowing through Šuš fought over where Daniel's coffin should be, they agreed to move it back and forth between their respective sides every year. Supposedly, the Seljuk ruler Sanjar stopped this practice in the 12th century Seljuk ruler, as he felt it was insulting to Daniel; he thus erected a tomb on a bridge. Whatever the truth of the matter, the original tomb was destroyed by a flood and the modern one built in 1870."

Early medieval Islamic sources mention the existence of a so-called Khuzi people, who spoke a language that modern scholars theorize to be a late remnant of ancient Elamite. Although Khuzi was spoken by local nobility, this may have been because they learned it from their servants (such as wet-nurses, bathroom attendants, and so on). The Khuzis were otherwise treated as low status; for example, #italic "yā Xuz̄ı!"#!, meaning "Hey, you Khuzi!" was reported by the 10th century Arab geographer Al-Maqdisi as a common, slang term of insult in the region. Because of this, the Khuzi identity and language likely faded away as the Khuzis assimilated into Arab or Iranian populations."

The poorer half resented this, and the two sides fought over where to have the sepulchre, until an agreement was reached that led to the present arrangement, and so both sides became rich."
