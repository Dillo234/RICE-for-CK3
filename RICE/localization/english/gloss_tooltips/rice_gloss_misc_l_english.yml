 # Culture
 VIETNAMESE_GLOSS: "The #bold Vietnamese#! are an ethnic group native to the country of Vietnam. During the timeframe of Crusader Kings, the ancestors of the modern Vietnamese, around the Red River Delta, often referred to themselves as the #bold Kinh#! people, or Jīng (京) in Chinese. The Kinh arose from speakers of Vietic languages who were Sinicized to a heavy extent over the centuries, and speakers of Chinese in Vietnam who assimilated into the Kinh. The Kinh contrast with other Vietic peoples, particularly the Mường, who were less Sinicized and remained in the highland reigons of northern Vietnam."
 DORSET_GLOSS: "The #bold Dorset#! were a Paleo-Eskimo culture that inhabited parts of northern Canada and Greenland starting around 500 BCE until somewhere between 1000 to 1500 CE. They do not appear to have any genetic connection with the Thule culture, the ancestors of the modern-day Inuit, who replaced them in the area. Inuit legends speak of encounters with a so-called #bold Tuniit#! peoples, large giants who were afraid to interact with and fight the Norse; the Tuniit may correspond to the Dorset peoples. There may have also been some contact between the Dorset and the Norse settlers in Greenland, though this is debated."
 INUIT_GLOSS: "The ancestors of the modern-day #bold Inuit#!, known archaeologically as the #bold Thule#! culture, arose in Alaska around the year 1000 and expanded eastwards into Canada and Greenland by the 13th century, replacing the previous inhabitants, the Dorset culture, who may correspond to the Tuniit, a race of giants in Inuit legends. There is limited evidence for contact between these proto-Inuit and the Norse settlers in Greenland, though the extent of this is debated. For instance, there are Inuit legends about the Norse, but these stories were recorded much later in the 19th century and may have also reflected then contemporary Inuit attitudes towards European colonization."
