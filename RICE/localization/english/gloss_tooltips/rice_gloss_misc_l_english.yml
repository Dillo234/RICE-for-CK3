 VIETNAMESE_GLOSS: "The Vietnamese are an ethnic group native to the country of Vietnam. During the timeframe of Crusader Kings, the ancestors of the modern Vietnamese, around the Red River Delta, often referred to themselves as the 'Kinh' people, or 京 ("Jīng" in Mandarin Chinese). The Kinh were effectively speakers of Vietic languages who were Sinicized to a heavy extent over the centuries, and speakers of Chinese in Vietnam who assimilated into the Kinh. They contrast with other Vietic peoples, particularly the Mường, who were less Sinicized and remained in the highland reigons of northern Vietnam."
