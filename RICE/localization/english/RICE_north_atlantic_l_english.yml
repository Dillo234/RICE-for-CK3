 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_settlement:0 "Settlement"
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_settlement_desc:0 "There is much opportunity in [colonizing_greenland|E] and possibly lands beyond, though there are also high risks given how distant it is from Europe.\n\nWith a favorable climate, cordial relations with the native inhabitants, and consistent export luxury goods like walrus ivory, [greenland|E] could prosper as it develops ties to North Atlantic political and trade networks, leading to an [struggle_phase_greenland_integration|E]. Conversely, political and economic changes elsewhere, and conflict with local natives, might disrupt the flow of trade and supplies and leave [greenlands|E] settlements in decline, resulting in a [struggle_phase_greenland_subsistence|E]."
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_integration:0 "Integration"
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_integration_desc:0 "Thanks to a successful [struggle_phase_greenland_settlement|E], [greenland_settlements|E] are well-connected with North Atlantic political and economic networks, thanks in part to the export of luxury goods, particularly walrus ivory. Meanwhie, peaceful relations with the native inhabitants also leads to expanded trade and cooperation. [greenland|E] is thriving enough, in fact, that there is also greater interest in exploring the lands beyond.\n\nHowever, all good things will have to come to an end. [greenland|E] is still small, and vulnerable to societal shocks from political and economic changes elsewhere that could bring about the [struggle_phase_greenland_subsistence|E]. If these shocks are disruptive enough, and the settlements unable to adapt, [greenland|E] will instead slide into the [struggle_phase_greenland_marginalization|E]."
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_subsistence:0 "Subsistence"
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_subsistence_desc:0 "Following a period of growth with the [struggle_phase_greenland_settlement|E] or [struggle_phase_greenland_integration|E], the [greenland_settlements|E] become fragile due to the long distances involved in supporting them and the difficulty of maintaining a presence in a harsh, cold land. Relations with the local natives are also increasingly tense.\n\nPolitical and economic changes elsewhere disrupt the flow of trade and supplies, and [greenland|E] becomes ever more reliant on northern Europe. The settlers must receive a boost in aid from Europe and redouble efforts to export valuable luxury goods, particularly walrus ivory, in order to reach the [struggle_phase_greenland_integration|E], or [greenland|E] will decline into a [struggle_phase_greenland_marginalization|E]."
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_marginalization:0 "Marginalization"
 struggle_RICE_greenland_phase_marginalization_desc:0 "The [greenland_settlements|E] are reliant on outside help for survival, yet are often ignored by the polities in Northern Europe. The formerly robust industry that revolved around the export of luxury goods, particularly walrus ivory, is in serious decline. Relations with [greenlands|E] native inhabitants are also fraught with distrust and even conflict.\n\nEventually, things might reach an equilibrium, as [greenland|E] settlers adapt to these new circumstances, and pull themselves into the [struggle_phase_greenland_subsistence|E]. Otherwise, they will fall deeper into a spiral of decline and into another [struggle_phase_greenland_marginalization|E]."
