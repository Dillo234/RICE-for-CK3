# Sher Bamiyan Family
# Ruling family of Bamiyan, probably lasted into the 10th century
# Mix of both Buddhists and Muslims
# No concensus on ethnic affiliation, scholars have suggested Turkic, Hephthalite, maybe even local Iranian
# As such, because of the Turkic and Hephthalite influence in the region, I've made them Turco-Hephthalites ruling over Afghans
