# Oranmiyan, legendary founder of Oyo and Benin
#
# NOTE ON HISTORICITY AND DATING:
#
# Vanilla has an Oranmiyan in the the 867 start date, but it's possible there were multiple historical figures who inspired the figure of Oranmiyan and others associated with him 
# Due to the many chronological discrepancies between different legends. For instance, Oranmiyan's supposed divine grandfather Oduduwa could've lived in the
# BCE millennium, 8th century, 9th century, 12th century, etc. based on different sources I've seen.
# However, it seems some scholarly estimates of the reigns of Benin and Oyo's earliest rulers (i.e. Oranmiyan's sons, if he was a real guy)
# date them to the 1200s, and thus estimate if Oranmiyan the founder of Oyo and Benin was real, he might've lived in the late 1100s/early 1200s
# I am thus interpreting him as not too closely connected with vanilla's Oduduwa since it chronically makes no sense, but hinting at the legend nonetheless.
# Otherwise, credits to BlackEmperor of the Africa Plus mod for ideas and other research.
# If he ever comes back to modding, I'll be happy to tweak this to fit his vision as it'll be much better than whatever I have.
