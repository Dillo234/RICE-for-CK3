RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places and peoples.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features won't appear unless it's a new game.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatibility]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. Compatches are available for:

[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828][B]Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded[/B][/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities).
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573060053][B]Unique Building Plus[/B][/url]
[/LIST]

Special content is also provided if you play with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2243307127][B]The Fallen Eagle[/B][/url].

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

[h1]Translations[/h1]
RICE uses the normal English text as a placeholder so you won't see gibberish for other languages, except Chinese and Korean, which have submods.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823178539][B]this submod by 牛奶大魔王[/B][/url] (thanks to Jujiote for the previous translations!)
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod
[*]German - Dillo has translated much of the mod; Dani has a machine translation [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877567899]sub-mod[/url], place it above in load order so it doesn't override Dillo's translations
[*]Korean - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2568582489][B]this submod by 티에[/B][/url]

[h1]Version 1.7.2.b Hotfix for "Leif Erikson"[/h1]

[LIST]
[*]Added new CBs that are functionally identical to the county and ducal conquest CBs for rulers in the Greenland struggle to use on those outside the struggle, as a workaround for the issue where the CBs we're disabled, to avoid editing vanilla code
[*]Added counties of North Riding (York), Dublin, and Middlesex (i.e. London) and the Duchy of Mann to the Greenland struggle region
[*]Added Eeyou (East Cree) and Innu names (credits again to Lahom for finding Native American names for me)
[*]Decision to explore Greenland is disabled for pre-medieval dates (like in TFE and WTWSMS)
[*]Reduced the discount you get on the decision to explore Greenland if you took the Icelandic Althing decision/are of North Germanic or Goidelic heritage
[*]Increased the base cost of the decision to explore Greenland to 250
[*]Increased how much Resilience and Networks can potentially increase when taking the decision to Support Greenland
[*]Reduced failure rate of Supporting Greenland to 20% (was previously 30%)
[*]Support Greenland decision now clarifies how much Resilience and Networks can potentially increase for each type of support
[*]Tweaked Resilience penalty for hunting trips to Nordsetur to be a bit more forgiving, especially for major and great hunts
[*]Increased grace period between each Vinland outpost failure from one year to five years (i.e. during the grace period, outposts will not fail)
[*]Reduced the impact of Viability on the chances of Vinland outposts failing - Viability now increases the chances at half rate normally, and a fifth rate after the Greenland struggle is resolved with a good ending (it’s still going to be tough) 
[*]Reduced the chances of Vinland outposts failing if the Greenland struggle has been resolved with a good ending
[*]Fixed Marginalization phase decreasing the chances of Vinland outposts failing instead of increasing it
[*]Fixed Decision to Organize a Hunting Trip to Nordsetur not decreasing Resilience if you resolved the Greenland struggle with a good ending

[/LIST]

[h1]Version 1.7.2.a Hotfix for "Leif Erikson"[/h1]

[LIST]
[*]Separated Native American heritages and languages in the code for some compatibility issues with Cultures Expanded and potentially other mods, like everyone getting the Native American decision or having no beards (this does not resolve CCU-related issues)
[*]Added catalyst for the Greenland struggle when taking the decision to Incorporate Inuit Ideas
[*]Added localization for Native American ethnicities
[*]Changed culture colors to HSV values for languages for better compatibility with other mods
[*]Decision to Send an Expedition to the West (and thus start the Greenland struggle) now requires having a capital in the struggle region, rather than just having any county in it
[*]Decision to Convene Iceland’s First Althing now properly displays the requirement that your capital needs to be in Iceland
[*]Both decisions to Establish Ivory Carving Centers no longer require needing a coastal county, and require having at least 10 development instead
[*]Fixed missing lines of code in Native American ethnicities files (added in “using = finnish”)
[/LIST]

[I]“After being tossed about at sea for a long time, Leif chanced upon land where he had not expected any to be found. Fields of self-sown wheat and vines were growing there. [....] Leif converted the country [Greenland] to Christianity. Afterward he became known as Leif the Lucky.”

- Two excerpts from the Saga of Erik the Red[/I]
