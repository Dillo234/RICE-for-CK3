RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places and peoples.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features won't appear unless it's a new game.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatibility]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. Compatches are available for:

[LIST]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828][B]Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded[/B][/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities).
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573060053][B]Unique Building Plus[/B][/url]
[/LIST]

Special content is also provided if you play with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2243307127][B]The Fallen Eagle[/B][/url].

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

[h1]Translations[/h1]
RICE uses the normal English text as a placeholder so you won't see gibberish for other languages, except Chinese and Korean, which have submods.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823178539][B]this submod by 牛奶大魔王[/B][/url] (thanks to Jujiote for the previous translations!)
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod
[*]German - Dillo has translated much of the mod; Dani has a machine translation [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877567899]sub-mod[/url], place it above in load order so it doesn't override Dillo's translations
[*]Korean - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2568582489][B]this submod by 티에[/B][/url]

[h1]Version 1.8.0 "Tuniit"[/h1]

[I]In Inuit legend, the Tuniit are a race of giants who preceded them and who, despite being taller and stronger, were supposedly timid and fearful of the Inuit. The Tuniit might correspond to the people belonging to the so-called archaeological Dorset culture, a pre-Inuit people inhabiting Greenland and Northern Canada before the arrival of the Inuit, who may have interacted with the Norse. They disappeared by the early modern period for reasons that are still debated.[/I]

Please note some changes will only take effect with new games. Because changelog is too big to list here, please see the change notes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2273832430

[LIST]
[*]Updated to vanilla patch 1.8 “Robe”
[*]Added new Kingdom Invasion CB that is functionally identical to the vanilla one for rulers in the Greenland struggle, as a workaround for the issue where the CB was disabled to avoid editing vanilla code
[*]Added additional French and German localization (thanks to NicolasGrosjean and Dillo respectively)
[*]Decision to explore the Americas is now more expensive than the one to explore Greenland (50 more gold by default)
[*]Abandon Greenland decision requires being below 300 Resilience and Networks
[*]AI will never take the decision to abandon Greenland unless Resilience and Networks are below 100
[*]Vinland’s viability now starts at 10 in the 1066 start date
[*]Increased the effect leader skills have on the results of some expedition results
[*]Slightly increased the chances of getting Native American courtiers from expeditions (it should still be rare, though)
[*]Made the AI slightly more likely to do walrus hunts and expeditions
[*]Decisions to explore Greenland and Americas now require either your capital to have at least 10 development, or controlling the Duchy of Iceland, or being a King or Emperor
[*]Decision to Sponsor a Whale Hunt now clarifies you need to own a coastal county
[*]Decision to Sponsor a Whale Hunt is now visible even if you don’t own a coastal county, but requirements still apply
[*]Temple of Hibis now gives 1% dynasty prestige instead of 0.5% (so it now displays properly too)
[*]Counties of Aalborg and Aarhus have been added to the Greenland struggle region
[*]Fixed being unable to retake the decision to Reinforce Relations with Silk Road after unlocking the second Silk Road dynasty perk, Envoys and Explorers (it was previously pegged to the third perk, rather than the second one)

[*]Fixed homosexuality doctrine of Semitic pagan faiths being accepted instead of shunned
[*]Fixed Nordsetur hunts automatically succeeding if your character dies
[*]Fixed modifiers from construction Shielings/Hunting Stations in Greenland not doing anything even though they’re supposed to (Temples doesn’t have a special effect yet, but this will be fixed in the next update)

[*]Fixed missing loc for Vinland Support decision tooltip
[*]Miscellaneous fixes for typos and minor bugs
