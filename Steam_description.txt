RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places and peoples.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features won't appear unless it's a new game.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatibility]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. Compatches are available for:

Special content is also provided if you play with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2243307127][B]The Fallen Eagle[/B][/url].

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as flavor events and music.

[h1]Translations[/h1]
RICE uses the normal English text as a placeholder so you won't see gibberish for other languages, except Chinese and Korean, which have submods.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823178539][B]this submod by 牛奶大魔王[/B][/url] (thanks to Jujiote for the previous translations!)
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod
[*]German - Dillo has translated much of the mod; Dani has a machine translation [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877567899]sub-mod[/url], place it above in load order so it doesn't override Dillo's translations
[*]Korean - please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2568582489][B]this submod by 티에[/B][/url]

[h1]Version 1.7.2 "Leif Erikson"[/h1]

[I]“After being tossed about at sea for a long time, Leif chanced upon land where he had not expected any to be found. Fields of self-sown wheat and vines were growing there. [....] Leif converted the country [Greenland] to Christianity. Afterward he became known as Leif the Lucky.”

- Two excerpts from the Saga of Erik the Red[/I]
