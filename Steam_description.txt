[h3][B]Note: If you're doing a Guanche playthrough on an old save, it is strongly advised you start a new game or use an older version of RICE (see GitHub to manually download). Otherwise, as PI added their own version of the Guanche, there may be wonkiness as some Guanche content might not work properly.

中国玩家注意：（抱歉使用谷歌翻译）如果你用中文玩RICE，请务必同时下载“牛奶大魔王”制作的翻译子模组，否则只会看到乱码：

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features will not appear on new saves.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatches]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

Special content is also provided if you're playing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2243307127][B]The Fallen Eagle[/B][/url].

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs). Compatches are available for:

[LIST]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828][B]Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded[/B][/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities).
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573060053][B]Unique Building Plus[/B][/url]
[/LIST]

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own if you want (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as generic flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

[h1]Version 1.6.2 "Wakhan"[/h1]

[I]The Wakhan Corridor is a mountain valley that lies between the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountain ranges. Since ancient times, this remote mountain pass has facilitated the movement of peoples, armies, ideas, and faiths across Eurasia.[/I]

Please note some changes will only take effect with new games. Because changelog is too big to list here, please see the change notes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2273832430

[LIST]
[*]Added Turco-Hephthalite culture as a hybrid of Hephthalite and Turkish, that appears on the map in 867 instead of the old Hephthalite culture, to clarify confusion arising from my previous usage of Hephthalite
[*]Added Pamiri culture to the Iranian culture group
[*]Added a new tradition, Beyond the Reach of Eagles, for the Pamiri, Burusho, and Peristani cultures
[*]Modified Guanche content to fit vanilla’s implementation of the Guanche
[*]Guanche paganism is now in a separate religion, Guanche, than the other Amazigh faiths (mainly to maintain compatibility)
[*]Renamed vanilla’s North African religion to Guanche (to distinguish them from the Amazigh)
[*]Pray for Blessings of Rain Rain and Benesmen Festival decisions now require the Guanche religion
[*]Removed decision to Unite the Canary Islands, since vanilla has something similar; however, you will still get the relevant county modifiers via event
[*]Rebalanced costs for most feast/festival type decisions
[*]White Hun tradition is now added to the Hephthalites via scripted effect at game start to ensure better compatibility
[*]White Hun tradition will no longer be added to the Hephthalites if playing with TFE or early start dates

[*]Activities are separated by flavor pack in different text files in the code
[*]Fixed Ali ibn Asad starting off as a Seljuk vassal instead of being independent
