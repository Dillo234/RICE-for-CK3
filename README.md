_The Darro, a tributary of the Genil river, is one of the main rivers flowing through Granada. In the medieval period, it was noted for its gold deposits. It also supplied the famed Alhambra with water through a canal system known as the Acequia Real, or the Sultan’s Canal._

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

NOTE: **If you are re-installing a mod manually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! It's a good habit to do to prevent potential issues.**
