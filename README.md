## Latest Version: Version 1.11.2 "Eleanor of Arborea" (Released 2/8/24, for vanilla patch 1.11.x)

**Newest Flavor Pack: *Sardinia: Reign of the Judges***

[**Discord**](https://discord.gg/9KuyXv2uZA) | [**Official Website**](https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com) | [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/Cybrxkhans_Mods)

_Eleanor of Arborea (1347-1404 CE) was one of the last independent judicati, or judges, of medieval Sardinia. She is known for resisting the Kingdom of Aragon’s attempts to exert greater influence over Arborea, and for the Carta de Logu, her legal code which was still in force in Sardinia until 1827._

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and is technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.


## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is a WIP version and not necessarily stable!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the "RICE" folder and "RICE.mod" file from the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

The mod folder should look something like this:

**NOTE**: When re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, make sure you are not subscribed to the Steam version of the mod, to prevent the launcher from getting confused as to which version to use.
