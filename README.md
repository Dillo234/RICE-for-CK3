## Latest Version: Version 1.8.0 "Tuniit" (Released 12/1/22, for vanilla patch 1.8.x)

**Newest Flavor Pack - North Atlantic: From Iceland to Vinland**

_In Inuit legend, the Tuniit are a race of giants who preceded them and who, despite being taller and stronger, were supposedly timid and fearful of the Inuit. The Tuniit might correspond to the people belonging to the so-called archaeological Dorset culture, a pre-Inuit people inhabiting Greenland and Northern Canada before the arrival of the Inuit, who may have interacted with the Norse. They disappeared by the early modern period for reasons that are still debated._

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places and peoples.

RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and is technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is a WIP version and not necessarily stable!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: **If you are re-installing a mod manually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! It's a good habit to do to prevent potential issues.**

## Latest Changelog

### 1.8.0 "Tuniit"

- Updated to vanilla patch 1.8 “Robe”
- Added new Kingdom Invasion CB that is functionally identical to the vanilla one for rulers in the Greenland struggle, as a workaround for the issue where the CB was disabled to avoid editing vanilla code
- Added additional French and German localization (thanks to NicolasGrosjean and Dillo respectively)
- Decision to explore the Americas is now more expensive than the one to explore Greenland (50 more gold by default)
- Abandon Greenland decision requires being below 300 Resilience and Networks
- AI will never take the decision to abandon Greenland unless Resilience and Networks are below 100
- Vinland’s viability now starts at 10 in the 1066 start date
- Increased the effect leader skills have on the results of some expedition results
- Slightly increased the chances of getting Native American courtiers from expeditions (it should still be rare, though)

- Decisions to explore Greenland and Americas now require either your capital to have at least 10 development, or controlling the Duchy of Iceland, or being a King or Emperor
- Decision to Sponsor a Whale Hunt now clarifies you need to own a coastal county
- Decision to Sponsor a Whale Hunt is now visible even if you don’t own a coastal county, but requirements still apply
- Temple of Hibis now gives 1% dynasty prestige instead of 0.5% (so it now displays properly too)
- Counties of Aalborg and Aarhus have been added to the Greenland struggle region
- Fixed being unable to retake the decision to Reinforce Relations with Silk Road after unlocking the second Silk Road dynasty perk, Envoys and Explorers (it was previously pegged to the third perk, rather than the second one)
- Fixed Icelandic marriage event not checking for clergy or other situations where the character can’t marry
- Fixed homosexuality doctrine of Semitic pagan faiths being accepted instead of shunned
- Fixed Nordsetur hunts automatically succeeding if your character dies
- Fixed modifiers from construction Shielings/Hunting Stations in Greenland not doing anything even though they’re supposed to (Temples doesn’t have a special effect yet, but this will be fixed in the next update)

- Fixed missing loc for Vinland Support decision tooltip
- Miscellaneous fixes for typos and minor bugs
