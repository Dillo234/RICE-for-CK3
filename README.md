# Public Beta (Initial version 5/29/23, for vanilla patch 1.9.x)

The public beta version of RICE is intended for vanilla's 1.9 patch and Tours & Tournaments update. Though it is stable, be aware that it is lacking some content and may be buggy. **Please carefully read the instructions and information below if you wish to use the beta.** Thanks for your understanding and patience!


# Manual Installation Steps

If you know how to use GitHub, you can skip this.

1. Download the zip version of the mod by clicking on the green "code" button and then the "download zip" button, as seen below:

2. Place the "RICE" folder and "RICE.mod" file in your mod folder. This is usually in Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod
3. Make sure RICE is selected in the launcher in your mod playlist. That should be it!

NOTE: **If you are re-installing a mod manually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! It's a good habit to do to prevent potential issues.**

# Important Information

1. The "beta" is available only through GitHub. You will need to know how to manually install mods and/or read instructions.
2. I do not advise you start long-term playthroughs with the beta - the WIP version is constantly changing, as code is added, removed, or changed, so this could mess with saves. The beta is meant for short playthroughs, messing around, and, if you are inclined, to provide feedback.
3. While the WIP version is mostly stable, be aware there are bugs and some content will be incomplete or not work. The error log will also be full of errors.
4. At this point I have firmly decided what will be in the update. Further suggestions are welcome but will likely not be implemented for this update even if I like them (unless they're minor) to save time.
5. For those who are bored and want to help with bug catching, I've heard reports that even vanilla with no mods is more CTD prone at the moment. I thus recommend not playing with many other heavy-duty mods to be safe, unless you want to help me test which mods are stable with RICE.
