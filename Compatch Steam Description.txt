[h1]Latest Version Released 11/20/23, compatible with vanilla patch 1.11.X[/h1]

[B]Manual Download/Older Versions available [url=https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases]on Github[/url]
[/B]

This is an optional compatibility patch for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273832430][B]Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (RICE)[/B][/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2507209632][B]Ethnicities & Portraits Expanded (EPE)[/B][/url].

RICE is already compatible with EPE. However, by default, RICE’s new cultures will use vanilla ethnicities (i.e. the physical appearance of characters) rather than ethnicities added by EPE - this compatch changes that, so RICE’s new cultures use EPE’s ethnicities as appropriate.

[B]For load order, put this compatch AFTER both RICE and EPE[/B]. Per the EPE team, RICE should be before EPE in the load order.

While I think you can add this compatch to an existing save game, please note that it will not affect any existing characters so it is recommended you use this with new playthroughs.

No compatch is needed for CFP+RICE. However, if you are using CFP and EPE, you will need the CFP+EPE compatch. The CFP+EPE compatch can be downloaded here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2507220129
