For example, [GetTrait('lustful').GetName( GetPlayer )] characters are better at composing #italic Cantigas de Amigo#! than [GetTrait('chaste').GetName( GetPlayer )] characters, who are better at #italic Cantigas de Amor#!.\n\nOther factors that lead to better compositions include if you've composed good cantigas before, and if your [culture|E] has the $tradition_RICE_galician_portuguese_poetry_name$ [tradition|E]."

The old tomb, while crude and cramped, was built by Saint James’ disciples, so they fear our actions are a blasphemous act of desecration that will incur divine punishment.
